I'm Roberto Carratal√°, an IT professional with ten years of experience in the industry of Linux, Virtualization, Cloud, DevOps and Kubernetes/Openshift.

Currently I am working as a Senior Specialist Solutions Architect for Red Hat, helping the customers to achieve their goals and objectives with linux, cloud and containers in public and private environments.

Although I work for Red Hat I still consider myself a Linux Geek and a Unix fanboy, searching always new techs for learn and for try!

In my free time, I really like the basketball (watch and practice also!), and spend time with my friends and family.

Opinions expressed in this blog are my own and do not necessarily reflect that of the company I work for.

Cheers!

Rober ;)
